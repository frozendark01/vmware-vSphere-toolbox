##Description :

This module contains one cmdlet : **Get-MultihomingInfo**, which has the alias **mhi**.

Obtains IP configuration information of all the VMkernel interfaces for one or more ESXi hosts and determines if the Multihoming configuration of the ESXi host is correct or not.

A correct Multihoming configuration means that the VMkernel interfaces for each type of traffic are in different IP subnets.
More information : http://kb.vmware.com/kb/2010877

This cmdlet obtains the following information for each VMkernel interface :
Name, IP Address, SubnetMask, Subnet, Type of VMkernel traffic and whether or not Multihoming is correctly configured.

It requires Powershell version 3 and the PowerCLI snap-ins for vSphere.

##Parameters :

**VIServer :** To specify the vCenter Server to connect PowerCLI to.
The default is Localhost.

**VMhosts :** To specify one or more ESXi hosts.  
The default will query all ESXi hosts managed by the vCenter Server you are connected to in PowerCLI.  
This parameter has 2 aliases : "Hosts" and "Servers".

**Cluster :** To query all the ESXi hosts in the specified cluster.

**Quiet :** This mode only outputs a boolean value for each ESXi host : $True if Multihoming is correctly configured, $False if not.
